# Assembly FizzBuzz

A brief introductory project to get acquainted with x86_64 assembly programming. This project runs on Linux systems.

## Build Instructions

To build, run `make`. To set the maximum number it will count to (must be less than 2^32 - 1, and greater than zero), set the max constant in `fizzbuzz.s`.

## Invocation

`fizzbuzz` ignores command line arguments.
